On October 2, St. Louis County Police and Missouri State Highway Patrol arrested more than a dozen people,[97] including Mary Moore, a freelance journalist who has worked for CNN.[98] Protesters were charged with offenses that included failure to comply with police, noise ordinance violations and resisting arrest. They had to wear orange jumpsuits and bonds were up to $2,700, then reduced to $1,000.[97] Police dismantled an encampment that lasted a few weeks on West Florissant. Police and protesters are adapting constantly to the other side's moves ("Itâ€™s a legal clinic on these streets."). The city recently raised bonds from $100 to $1,000.[93]

On October 3, Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson ceded responsibility for managing protests in the city to the St. Louis County police department. The limited resources of Ferguson police made it difficult to handle daily protests after their resumption the previous week.[99]

On October 4, about 50 protesters briefly delayed a concert of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. Just before the performance resumed after intermission, they started singing an old civil rights tune, unfurled three hand-painted banners and scattered paper hearts that read: "Requiem for Mike Brown". After that, they left the building peacefully.[100]

On Monday evening, October 6, after a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Los Angeles Dodgers, baseball supporters and protesters had a chanting battle outside the stadium.[101]

A website, Ferguson October, as well as other organizations, planned a massive week of resistance throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area. The event, Ferguson October, began on Friday afternoon when protesters peacefully marched to County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch's office in Clayton, Missouri.[102] Later until around 2:30 a.m., mostly peaceful protests took place in Ferguson and the Shaw neighborhood. As many as 400 people took to the streets on Friday night. On October 9, 2014, Ferguson October sparked the activation of the St. Louis County Emergency Center in anticipation.[103] Police are also working longer shifts and the Missouri National Guard can be activated if needed.[102]

On October 12, 2014, a Ferguson October rally and service was held at Chaifetz Arena. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim clergy addressed the crowd. Younger activists criticized older activists for not being radical enough. When the keynote speaker, Cornel West, took the stage, he said, "I didn't come here to give a speech. I came here to go to jail!"[104]

On October 13, 2014, protesters attempted to cross police lines to meet with officers at the Ferguson Police Department. Dozens of protesters (over 50) were arrested, during a staged and peaceful act of disobedience, including clergy and Cornel West.[105]

On October 20, Missouri Senator Jamilah Nasheed was arrested in front of the Ferguson Police Department building for blocking traffic in the street and not respecting police orders. She was taken into custody, along with a man who was accompanying her, and refused bond.[106][107][108]

On November 24, the grand jury decided not to indict Wilson in the shooting death of Brown.[111] Following the announcement of the grand jury's decision, Michael Brown's stepfather Louis Head yelled to the crowd of protesters in front of the police department: "Burn this bitch down!"[112] There were peaceful protests as well as rioting. A dozen buildings were burned down; there was gunfire, looting, vandalism, and destruction of two St. Louis County Police patrol cars, as well as burning of various non-police cars.[113][114][115] Police in Ferguson deployed tear gas and ordered protesters in the street to disperse. There were 61 people arrested in Ferguson on charges including burglary and trespassing. In one case, firefighters evacuated the scene of a fire due to gunshots being heard, and for the same reason could not respond to other fires.[116][117]

On November 25, the body of a man was found inside a parked car within a few blocks of where Brown was killed. Police initially classified the death as suspicious but later ruled it a homicide.[118] That same day, CNN reported that thousands of people rallied to protest the grand jury's decision in more than 170 U.S. cities from Boston to Los Angeles, and that National Guard forces were reinforced at Ferguson to prevent the situation from escalating.[119]

On November 27, Governor Nixon reportedly rejected calls for a new grand jury to decide whether to charge Wilson over the killing of Michael Brown.[120]
